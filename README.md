# Census-Income-Data-Analysis
# Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about adult incomes and aims to determine whether an individual's income exceeds or falls below $50,000. It consists of 15 different attributes that describe various characteristics of the adults, including age, education, occupation, and more.

# Data Exploration

The purpose of this dataset is to investigate the connections between the various features and the target attribute, which is income. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into the factors that contribute to an individual's income level.

The dataset includes a combination of categorical and numerical data. Categorical information includes attributes such as education and occupation, while numerical information includes attributes such as age and capital gain. 
Missing Data Handling

Before starting the analysis, it's crucial to handle any missing data in the dataset. This can be done using various techniques, such as imputation or deletion of rows/columns with missing values. The specific method chosen will depend on the extent and nature of the missing data.
